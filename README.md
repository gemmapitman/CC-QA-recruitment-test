# Clear Channel QA Engineer Recruitment Test

## Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. 

The test is comprised of three parts:
1. Review and suggest improvements for a feature file
2. Create 2 new BDD scenarios using the Gherkin syntax and add them to the feature file
3. Automate the three scenarios

Once you have completed all three activites, please create a zip file containing your answers and email it to the recruiter. This will then be passed on to the hiring manager at Clear Channel.

The zip file should contain a folder which includes the search.feature file and all associated automation code from the technical test

## Instructions

### TASK 1: Review and improve a feature file

As a member of the QA team, your role will include peer reviewing BDD scenarios (written using the Gherkin syntax) and step definitions written by other members of the team. 

In this repo there is a file named ``search.feature`` Imagine this has been created by another QA Engineer on your team. Please take a copy of the feature file. Once you have a copy, please review the contents of the feature file and update or change anything which you think can be improved upon.

### TASK 2: Add scenarios to the feature file

Create two additional scenarios which will test the search functionality on the website. Choose the two which you think will add the most value. 

Add these to ``search.feature``

### TASK 3: Automate the three scenarios

Please implement step definitions for the three scenarios using any language or framework of your choice. 

In addition to the automation code, please provide a readme with clear instructions on how to execute the tests you have written. 

When you have completed tasks 1-3, please create a zip file containing all of your work.

## What we are looking for:

**After you have submitted your technical test, we will be assessing the following:**

* **Identifying opportunities for improvement** - what changes have you made to the sample Gherkin scenario? Have these changes improved it? 
* **Code quality** - do the tests compile and run? Does each scenario test what is is meant to? 
* **Readibility** - is the feature file and automation code written in a way that is easy for others to understand? Does the Readme provide adequate intructions?
